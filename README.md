# AnalogClock
Today, Clocks are a useful element for any UI if appropriately used. For example, clocks can be used in sites where time is the primary concern,
like some booking sites, or apps show arriving times of trains, buses, flights, etc. The clock is basically of two types, Analog and Digital.
I wanted to see how easy it is to create an analog one with basic HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
So, in this project, I create a simple Analog Clock.
